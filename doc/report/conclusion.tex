\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

We observed an up to $1.95\times$ increase in performance in terms of \% time spent in GC and on average $1.5\times$ throughput by implementing a parallel garbage collector. Using a language with static safety guarantees (Rust) helped implementing parallelization correctly by catching non-thread safe accesses in compile time.

Although we didn't improve sweep time by parallelizing it due to sweep being memory-bound, Boehm\cite{boehm's paper} claims that sweep time is not that important and suggests an optimization that offloads sweeping emptied pages to allocations when new pages are needed. Julia already implements such an optimization. In the future, we can implement such an optimization to also decrease time spent during sweeping. Another future improvement is designing a better load balancing method (like keeping a thread-local counter for work being done) to divide the work into more even chunks and to increase parallelization further.
