\section{Summary} \label{summary}
As dynamic languages become increasingly more popular, the need for quicker, safer, and more scalable automatic memory management in these systems becomes increasingly more important.
Garbage collection in such systems involves reclaiming memory that is no longer needed by a program, and if done improperly, can cause undesirable degradation in program performance and throughputs and unacceptable increases in latency.
Julia is a dynamically-typed, scientific programming language that aims to be highly performant, but unfortunately, its garbage collector is single-threaded and stop-the-world, causing it to miss out on possible speedups from the utilization of multicore processors.
Our project, \textbf{Neptune}, is a multithreaded garbage collector for Julia, written in Rust, that aims to be safe and highly-parallel.
Neptune achieves an average speedup of ???\%, a ???\% increase in throughput and ???\% decrease in latency, over Julia's garbage collector.
We show that exploiting the strengths of a modern, strongly- and statically-typed systems language allows us to create a performant parallel garbage collector for Julia.
